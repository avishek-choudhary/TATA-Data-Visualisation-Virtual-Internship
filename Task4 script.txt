Good day, I'm delighted to be here today. My name is Avishek Choudhary, and I want to thank you for giving me this wonderful opportunity to present you with valuable insights about your company based on your inquiries. Your specific questions have been instrumental in guiding me towards the analysis you require. Rest assured, the analysis I've conducted is based on accurate and up-to-date data. I've taken great care in cleaning the data by removing records with negative quantities and unit prices, ensuring that the insights I provide are truly useful.

First and foremost, let's address your query about the revenue trend and determine whether retail sales exhibit any seasonal patterns. Upon analyzing the data, I discovered distinct months where sales show significant spikes. From January to August, the revenue remains steady, averaging at around $685K per month. However, come September, we observe a notable upturn, with a 40% growth compared to the previous month. This upward trend continues until November, culminating in the highest revenue of $1.5 million for the entire year. Unfortunately, we don't have sufficient data for December to draw any conclusions. It's clear that seasonality plays a significant role in retail store sales, particularly in the final four months of the year.

Moving on, I've identified the top 10 countries with tremendous growth potential, excluding the UK due to its already high demand. Upon analysis, the data indicates that the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France exhibit substantial sales and income figures. I highly recommend focusing on these nations to capitalize on their growth potential.

Next, I delved into the purchasing habits of the top 10 consumers who made the most significant number of purchases from the company. Surprisingly, there are minimal differences in the purchasing patterns among these consumers. The consumer generating the highest revenue spent only 17% more than the second highest spender. This demonstrates that the company doesn't rely solely on a small number of consumers to generate income, and negotiations with consumers are relatively limited. Overall, this suggests a positive state of affairs for the business.

Lastly, I've prepared a map chart that compares the revenue-generating regions with the ones that don't, excluding the UK. The data reveals that the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, and Australia are the primary contributors to high profits. It would be prudent for the company to consider investing more in these nations to stimulate further product demand. Additionally, the map highlights that the majority of sales occur within the European zone, with only a small portion in the American region. On the other hand, there seems to be little market potential for the products in Africa, Asia, and Russia. By implementing a fresh strategy in these regions, it's possible to boost sales revenue and overall profitability.

Thank you for your time, and I encourage you to reach out with any questions or if you require any further analysis once you've reviewed the material.
